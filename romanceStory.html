        <p class = 'romance-path'>Once upon a time, <span class ='char-text'></span> met his/her best friend superhero
            named <span class = 'superhero-text'></span> in the enchanted SuperHero-forest. <span class = 'superhero-text'></span> wore a <span class ='clothes-text'></span>
            and he seemed upset that day. <span class = 'char-text'></span> asked <span class= 'superhero-text'></span> about his troubles and <span class = 'superhero-text'></span>
            told to <span class = 'char-text'></span> that he fell in love with a beautiful belle that he had met in a party
            at the first sight. The beautiful belle wore a beautiful <span class='color-text'></span> dress.<br/>
            <span class = 'superhero-text'></span> invited her to a resturant for dinner and asked her to marry him.
            But the beautiful belle said, "I'll accept if you buy me a <span class = 'animal-text'></span> with <span class = "color-text"></span> color.
            Then, we can get married on October <span class = 'number-text'></span>, 2018." 
            <br/><br/>
            <span class = 'superhero-text'></span> was upset because he did not know where can he find <span class = 'animal-text'></span>.
            You helped <span class = 'superhero-text'></span> search high and low to far and near...... and you 2 finally found the elusive <span class = 'animal-text'></span>.
            Needless to say thanks to <span class = 'char-text'></span>'s great help, <span class = 'superhero-text'></span> and the beautiful belle got married and lived happily after. The End.</p>
