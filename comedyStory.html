    <span class ='story-text'>

        <p class = 'comedy-path'>Once upon a time, <span class = 'char-text'></span> met a superhero named 
            <span class = 'superhero-text'></span> in the theater and they became best friends. 
            One of <span class = 'char-text'></span>'s highest aspiration was to become a supehero.
            <span class = 'char-text'></span> talked about his/her aspiration with <span class = 'superhero-text'>    
            </span> and ask him to borrow his power just for one day.<br/><br/>

            <span class = 'superhero-text'></span> accepted. They went looking for a witch that could cast a spell. 
            The witch wore a <span class = 'clothes-text'></span> that was <span class = 'color-text'></span> color.
            She told them I can do that on <span class = 'number-text'></span> of every month if you bring for me
            <span class = 'animal-text'> </span>. They provided a <span class = 'animal-text'></span>
            and came back to the witch on <span class = 'number-text'></span> of month. The witch started magic, 
            but she accidentally made a mistake and moved all of the <span class = 'superhero'></span>'s power to
            <span class = 'animal-text'></span>. 
            Needless to say that this created some amazing moments when the <span class = 'animal-text'></span>
            tried to save the world for the next month. Remember the witch can only cast spells on the 
            <span class = 'number-text'></span> of the month. 
            The End.</p>
